    "## One time pad encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "One time pad encryption is a perfectly secure means of communicating a message. Alice takes the original message, the raw text, and encrypts it with a pad of random bits the same length as the message, resulting in the ciphertext. Alice transmits the ciphertext through a public channel to Bob. The channel is public because an eavesdropper Eve is able to intercept the entire message. Once Bob receives the ciphertext, he decrypts the ciphertext using the same pad Alice used initially. This allows him to read the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of OTP is its security: it's impossible for an eavesdropper to decode the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawbacks are the key distribution. You need a key that's the same length as the message. Additionally, you need a new key for every message you want to encrypt and send: the protocol is only secure when each pad is used only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the challenge is generating and distributing a new key for each message. *This* is the gap that QKD aims to fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below is designed as a very basic tutorial for how OTP works. Encrypting and decrypting a message is simple: bitwise XOR with the key. If you XOR the raw message with the key, you get the ciphertext. Then if you XOR the cypher test with the key, you get the initial message back."

    "BB84 is possibly the most well-known QKD protocol, but there are others. One important protocol is Ekert 91, which was published in 1991. Its main difference from BB84 is that it relies on the correlation of entangled photons. In this protocol, Alice and Bob each get one photon from a source of entangled photons and then do independent measurements on the polarization of their photon and report back which basis they used - either horizontal-vertical or diagonal-antidiagonal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artur Ekert, who first publised the protocol, has made many YouTube videos on quantum information in general and QKD in particular. He teaches a class whose lecture materials are available online, and the [QKD lectures](https://qubit.guide/9-quantum-cryptography.html) are gathered together. For this text, I've embedded one short video where Ekert walks through the protocol. You'll note that he uses X and Z measurements on qubits. This is analogous to measuring the polarization in either the horizontal-vertical or diagonal-antidiagonal basis of linearly polarized photons."
