    "First, let's take a high level overview of how spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) works. SPDC occurs when a pump photon is converted into 2 photons of less energy. Traditionally, one output photon is called the signal and the other is called the idler.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Phase Matching Conditions\n",
    "One important feature of SPDC is the fact that it always obeys energy conservation: the energy of a pump photon before SPDC occurs is equal to the sum of the signal and idler photons after SPDC occurs.\n",

    "Matching the momentum is an a challening part of generating SPDC. As you recall, $\\overrightarrow{k} = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\lambda}$ where $n$, the index of refraction, is a function of $\\lambda$, the wavelength of the light.

    "## Mathematical Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the quantum optics, it's valuable to look at how SPDC can be described mathematically. First, let's consider the initial state of the system before SPDC occurs. We have a very powerful pump beam, which we express as a coherent state with eigenvalue $\\alpha_p$. The signal and idler states are both vacuums, which are number states with 0 photons in them. So the initial state is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = |0_s,0_i,\\alpha_p\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain the interaction Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{si}$ from the expection of the pump laser field $$| \\alpha_p\\rangle = \\hat{D}(\\alpha_p) |0\\rangle $$ where the displacement operator $$\\hat{D}(\\alpha_p)$$ creates the coherent state in mode p. Let's assume  $$\\alpha_p \\in \\mathbb{R} $$ to avoid some math tedium. Then, in the interaction picture,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we explicitly factored out the $\\hbar$ term to simplify the subsequent math since that $\\hbar$ will be canceled by the $\\hbar$ in the denominator of the time dependent Schrodinger equation, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi(t)\\rangle = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} H |\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Nonlinear optics\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, SPDC is a fundamentally quantum process: it can't be described by classical nonlinear optics. In classical nonlinear optics, parametric ampification is the process where you combine a source with frequency $\\omega_p$ and another source frequency with $\\omega_i$ in a nonlinear crystal to generate a field at $\\omega_s = \\omega_p - \\omega_i$ and amplify the field at $\\omega_i$. This is similar to SPDC in that you're generating light at a wavelength longer than the pump, but it's disimilar in that it *requires* a non-zero input at $\\omega_i$. This is what makes SPDC spontaneous: the output at the signal and idler aren't stimulated by any input because the input is in the vacuum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further reading\n",
    "\n",
    "For a good overview of SPDC with additional details, this [Review Article](https://doi.org/10.1080/00107514.2018.1488463 'DOI') is recommended. Additionally, for more information about designing a system to produce SPDC, the [HC Photonics PPLN GUIDE: Overview](https://www.hcphotonics.com/ppln-guide-overview) is very informative. For nonlinear optics, Robert W. Boyd's *Nonlinear Optics* is an excellent textbook."

    "\n",
    "Briefly, a photodetector uses a photodiode to generate a photocurrent, which can be amplified or measured directly. The high level understanding is that you shine a light on a device, and the light is absorbed and creates a current. Figure {numref} `Detector` below shows a basic cartoon of the process. A photodiode is a semiconductor device based on a crystal structure. In this type of crystal structure, one region has mobile electrons while another has mobile positive charges, called holes. When an incident photon (energy $h\\nu$) has enough energy to overcome the bandgap energy $E_g$, it can excite an electron and a hole enough that an applied voltage will move the charge carriers. This movement of charge generates a photocurrent.\n",

These observables are the second-order coherence terms of the two harmonic oscillators, represented by the combinations of creation and annihilation operators.
