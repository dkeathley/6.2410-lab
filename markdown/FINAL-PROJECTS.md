# Final Design Project

On this space we will provide written guidelines for the final design project assignment.  The final design project will consist of three phases: (1) a proposal phase; (2) a work phase; and (3) a reporting phase.  The final report will consist of a final written report as well as a final presentation.

As the proposal and project phases conclude, we will share links here to all final proposals, reports, and presentations.

## Project Proposals

### Written Guidelines

Please see written guidelines for the project proposals [here (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ftvYF-KIGi2gkzeMgGQJRtE252eFyHcWcFFTZP-jn3M/edit#).  In the document you will also find suggested topics for final projects that we will discuss in class.

### Proposal Development Slides with Suggested Topics

Please see the slides introducing the proposal development process along with suggested topics as discussed in class [here (Google Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ST1wsKs1KmI9-RUzv8aG9F8pNdpm1jXalQ1gz-MLefc/edit#slide=id.g22a3ce6831a_2_12).

We will also be updating the list of suggested projects in the coming day or two, and the suggestions will be listed here on this website as well.

**Your group is by no means restricted to these suggested topics.**  The key deliverable is a viable proposal that you pitch, revise, and then get approved by the instructional staff before commencing work on your final project.
