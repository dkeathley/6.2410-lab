This session, you will measure quantitatevely to determine the cavity's intrinsic Q. Remember that the loaded $Q\\propto 1/\\kappa_c$ and the coupling rate to the loop coupler $\\kappa_1$ are both functions of $z$.\n","\n","Measure and record the loaded $Q$ at various loop coupler heights. Be sure to have the loop coupler as directly above the microwave resonator to remove any $x,y$ dependence. The cable to the loop coupler can bend slightly. You will have some flexibility in how to measure height. Rough measurement is ok. Note that you do not need to directly measure $z$ (height between the loop and top of the cavity); a height meausrement relative to a convenient feature will work. If you record multiple heights with a common offset, you will be able to fit for this offset and recover that actual $z$. Fit your plot with an exponential function, e.g. $\\propto 1-exp(-z)$ (add an appropriate offset term if necessary). Use your fit to estimate the intrinsic quality factor, $Q_0\\propto 1/\\kappa_0$.\n","\n","Then, generate a plot of $\\kappa_1$ as a function of $z$.\n","\n","#### ii) Plot the frequency difference between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=\\pm 1$ states as a function of magnetic field (in Gauss)\n","\n","#### iii) Generate a 1D plot of the cavity reflection coefficient\n","\n","Recall that the cavity reflection coefficient is defined as:\n","\n","$$\\Gamma(\\omega) = -1+\\frac{\\kappa_{c1}}{\\frac{\\kappa_c}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_c)+\\frac{g^2}{\\frac{\\kappa_s}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_s)+\\alpha}}$$\n","\n","For simplicity, let's first take $g=0$.
