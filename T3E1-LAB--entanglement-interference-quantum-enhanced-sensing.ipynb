    " 4. Tap the top of either source perisocope on the left to activate the source view on the control pad.  Adjust the mirrors A1, A2, and B1 and B2 to optimize the count rates on both detectors.  (Tip: if the system seems far out of alignment, you can use the adjustement laser at very low power, a few percent, to help get started here).  \n",
    " 5. Now, focusing on coincidence events (A and B), adjust the same mirrors to optimize coincidence counts.  This might result in slightly less  than optimum total counts.  Tha is OK.

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this aim is to think more critically about the histogram and how it is being compiled.  To do this, we will put it to use to measure the speed of light.  In terms of experimental capabilities, you will learn how to align two beams such that they are perfectly overlapped in space after a beam-combiner (i.e. along the exact same line).  We will use this skill a lot as we move forward when aligning interferometers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the short duration of the coincidence histogram peak in time, we can use it to measure the speed of light as the photons travel across the board.  We can do this by splitting off some photons in one arm so that they travel a longer distance than the other -- those photons then  experience a longer delay time before making it to the detector.  Thus, when looking for coincidences, we now will find a double-peaked histogram.   \n",

    "\n",
    " 1. Activate the adjustment laser to full power so you can see it.\n",
    " 2. Starting from your aligned source in **Aim 1**, add in a beamsplitter to one of the paths.  \n",
    " 3. Using the target block with cross-hairs, align the beam to a separate point at the location you will place a first 45 degree mirror as shown in {numref}`fig-t3e1-lab-speed-of-light-setup`.  After alignment, place the lower-left mirror on the board.  \n",
    " 4. Repeat step (2) at the location of the second 45 degree mirror and then add the second mirror.\n",

    " 6. Use a dark object to block your newly created beampath.  Using the path $A$ source mirrors, optimize the top path into the detector.  This ensures that this path is perfectly aligned, and we now simply need to make our new path take this exact same trajectory.   \n",
    " 7. We now need to make sure the two paths are perfectly overlapped in space (*i.e.* that they lie on the exact same line after the second beamsplitter).  To do this we need to adjust the beams so that they are overlapped at the beamsplitter *and* at some distant point. Place a card behind the beamsplitter on the quantenkoffer display panel, or just use the display panel surface.  Use the second 45 deg mirror, align the two red beams so they are overlapped (see {numref}`fig-t3e1-lab-sol-near-alignment`)\n",
    " 8. Remove the periscope and project the red beams on a distant target (e.g. a white panel or wall).  Now use the second beamsplitter to align the two beams so they overlap (see {numref}`fig-t3e1-lab-sol-far-alignment`). \n",
    " 9. Repeat (6) and (7) until no adjustement is needed.\n",
    " 10. In this final part, we now go back to observing the histogram. In the coincidence histogram, you should now see two peaks.  If not, or if one is faint, you can fine adjust the mirror and beamsplitter from (6) and (7) to achieve a balanced two-peak structure (however, this is not strictly needed for this measurement).  \n",

Leave the source vertically-polarized such that you only generate the $\\ket{H}_a\\ket{H}_b$ state.  Orient the half waveplates each to 22.5 degrees.

(To explain your answer, calculate the probability of coincidences using the same method in the pre-lab, but now accounting for the input state $\\ket{H}_a\\ket{H}_b$ and accounting for the half waveplates in each arm.

    "#### Part 2: Interaction-Free Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will use the interferometer to demonstrate the concept of [interaction-free measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction-free_measurement).  For the case of single photons, it is possible to detect the presence of an object in one of the interferometer arms without actually interacting with it.  If the interferometer is aligned on a null, an object placed into one of the arms will casue the signal at the output to increase.  These photons sensed the presence of the object, without being absorbed!\n",

    "## Aim 6: Single-Photon Interference and NOON State Generation -- Hong Ou Mandel Effect (Day 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will interfere two single photons and observe the Hong Our Mandel effect which leads to photon bunching at the two output ports of the interferometer.  The highly entangled output state forms a NOON state that have received interest for their potential application in quantum-enhanced sensing, which you will explore in detail as part of calculations in the post-lab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The observation of strong photon bunching through the interference of two single photon states is not trivial.  One significant complication is that the photons must be completely indistinguishable as they interfere on the beamsplitter.  To achieve this, the spatial modes and temporal properties of the photons have to be well-matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, both photons come from the same source which help us to ensure matched properties as they are emitted.  To then ensure matched spatial mode profiles, we will interfere the photons within a single-mode fiber beam combiner (similar to a beamsplitter, but achieved in fiber).  Since only the fundamental mode of the fiber can propagate, this ensures perferct matching of the spatial modes of the two photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup is shown in {numref}`FIXME`.  Follow the following steps for alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1:** Align the fiber couplers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this part is to couple the single-photon sources into two fibers.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Place a fiber coupler with attached fiber onto the board after the source port of A.  Attach the other end of the fiber to the input port for the detector F (the fiber port on the right of the Quantenkoffer).\n",
    " 2. Using the adjustment laser, use the fiber adjusters to maximize signal into port F (you might have to lower the adjustment laser strength if you saturate).  \n",
    " 3. Now, use the two source mirrors for A to fine-tune and optimize alignment.  \n",
    " 4. When finished with the adjustment laser, you can switch it off and then optimize the single photon input.\n",
    " 5. Repeat steps 1-4 with another fiber coupler and the output of source B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:** Optimize for coincidence counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this part is to ensure that the two single-photon arms are aligned for optimal coincidence counts.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Connect one fiber output port directly to F.  \n",
    " 2. Connect the other fiber output port to a fiber coupler.  Place this coupler and a 45 degree mirror to direct it into the detector port for A.  \n",
    " 3. Align the output of this fiber coupler to the detector for A.  You may need the adjustment laser for optimization before switching to the single-photon source.\n",
    " 4. Once detectors A and F have signal, optimize thier coincident cout rate (this shoudl be in the thousands).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3:** Align the fiber beam splitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fiber beam-splitter component has two free-space arms, one of them with a delay stage.  This is essential as for the HOM interference, you need to adjust the delay to find temporal overlap of the two photons.  The goal of this part is to ensure that the free-space arms are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Attach the two single-photon ports to each input arm of the beamsplitter.  \n",
    " 2. The alignment should be close, so attach one of the fiber outputs to detector F and then optimize.  Block one arm at a time and optimize them each individually (minimum alignment should be required here).  \n",
    " 3. When finished, attach the other output of the beamsplitter to the port A fiber coupler (on board).  Fine tune this alignment for maximum detection at detector A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 4:** Find the HOM dip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step you simply watch the coincidence couts as you scan the fiber delay arm with the interferometer.  Move slowly!  Remember that the bandwidth of your source leads to a small spatial overlap window where you will see an effect (related directly to your single-photon interference measurements).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**AIs** (1) What is the spatial length over which you see the HOM dip?  (2) How strong is the dip as a percentage of total coincidences when not overlapped?  Why might this contrast not be 100 percent? (3) Be sure to read the section in the text extending this approach to perform N=2 NOON-state interferometry and be sure to complete the post-lab questions.  The experiences gained in this measurement should help inform your answers there with regard to engineering challenges to such approaches.  \n"
