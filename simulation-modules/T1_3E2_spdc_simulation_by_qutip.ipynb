    "# Activity 1: SPDC Simulation by QuTip\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum optics relies on a reliable source of single photons and entangled photon pairs.  A typical source of these photons is spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) within a nonlinear crystal.  For example, all of the quantum optics experimental lab modules in this class rely on SPDC.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will simulate the SPDC process and the quantum states of light it generates.  We will do this through the formalism of the degenerate parametric amplifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific aims of this activity are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Enrich your understanding of the SPDC process.\n",
    " * Develop a realistic model of an SPDC source that could be further extended and used in the context of device and technology simulation and design.\n",

    "The SPDC process works by driving a nonlinear crystal with strong light at a pump frequency $\\omega_p$.  One photon of the pump light is then spontaneously converted into two photons $\\omega_s$ and $\\omega_i$, which refer to the signal and idler modes respectively.  This naming convention was developed to describe parametric amplfiers where one wanted to amplify a weak signal using a strong pump.  Energy conservation requires that this also corresponds with the growth of an idler wave, and you have that $\\omega_p = \\omega_s + \\omega_i$.  In the SPDC process we are concerned with the spontaneous generation of the signal and idler.  These occupy modes as $a$ and $b$ respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric amplification occurs due to a nonlinear coupling between the fields of the pump, signal, and idler waves.  The coefficient describing the strength of this coupling is the nonlinear coefficient $\\chi_2$, which is in general complex, but given freedom in choice of phase, we take it as a positive real number here.\n",

In fact, similar processes to what you are modeling are used to generate bright squeezed light that is enabling ultra-precise interferometric measurements.  To see how squeezed states can be used to reduce the readout noise of an interferometer, see [](content-t3e1-extras-homodyne-detection).\n",
