## Overview

This course covers an introduction to experimental methods and systems engineering in quantum information science and engineering, with a focus on technology areas of (T1) quantum computing, (T2) quantum communications, and (T3) quantum sensing and quantum metrology.  These technology areas will be explored through both simulation and experimental platforms that are introduced in prepared laboratory exercises.  The prepared laboratory exercises will be broken into three platforms with four modules: (E1) quantum optics which consists of two modules that cover entanglement, single-photon interference, quantum key distribution, and quantum-enhanced sensing; (E2) quantum computing module with IBM Qiskit; and (E3) solid-state spin systems module with a focus on quantum sensing and magnetometry.  

The first 7 weeks of the semester will include an introduction to the laboratory and equipment, basic training, and prepared laboratory exercises with each of the experimental modules.  A rotating system will be used such that each group spends 4 laboratory periods (2 per week, 2 hours each) at each module before rotating to the next.  

The prepared laboratory exercises will be completed in groups.  The general structure of each lab will include: recorded lecture videos (approximately 1-2 hours) and lecture notes that include pre-lab questions that are to be submitted for grading; implementation of experiments in the laboratory with individual lab notebook check-ins; and the writing of summaries and reports (approximately 6 hours). 

The prepared laboratory exercises will be followed by a 2-week period with individual work on the quantum computing Qiskit module.  During this time, students will also prepare group proposals for their team’s open-ended design lab project.  This proposal development period will include conversations with instructors and TAs (during scheduled course/laboratory time) who will provide advice and eventual approval of each team’s final project plan.  After proposal plans are developed, teams will present their plans.

The course will conclude with a 3-4 week open-ended design project based on each group’s proposal.  This will conclude with a final report and presentation.  


## Course Materials

The course will provide an online textbook (this website) with interactive lecture notes and videos.  These lecture notes will provide suggested reading and references for further reading where relevant.

## Grading

Assessment will rely on participation and practice as well as pre-lab exercises or quizzes, as well as laboratory reports.

The grading will be based on:
  - 4 Written Summaries (~2-3 pages each)  — 15%
  - Lab notebook -- 10% 
  - Lab Performance and Attendance -- 10%
  - Pre-lab questions -- 10%
  - Open-ended design lab proposal and presentation – 15% 
  - Open-ended design laboratory (final report and presentation) -- 40%

## Open-Ended Design Project

Students will select open-ended design projects following on core material covered in the technology areas (T) and experimental platforms (E). Students will be able to pursue projects that focus in varying degrees on design, construction, and testing of software or hardware, emphasizing different concentrations from 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. The projects will include a final research report and presentation.  Note that there is a two-week proposal period that is essential for the development of a successful project plan.  These plans will incorporate feedback from course instructors and TAs, and will have to be approved by instructors and TAs.  Project effort begins as soon as a proposal plan is approved.
