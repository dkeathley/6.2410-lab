This would us to store $2^N$ complex numbers, i.e., $2^{N+1}$ real numbers. Suppose each real number were stored in a 32-bit classical register. Then we'd need $32\\times2^{N+1}$ bits.

In a quantum computer, a register of 500 qubits would suffice!

Quantum error correcting codes are a way to process quantum information reliably in the presence of noise.  Quantum error correction is a complex subject. Here, we'll consider just a simple example that protects against bit-flip errors in quantum channels. Bit flip errors is just one class of a range of sources of noise, which also include phase flip errors. \n",

    "Let's first consider an example of consider error correction codes: majority voting with three bits. Suppose you have a classical bit in a noisy channel, where the channel just refers to a path in space or time.  The channel could represent a photon flying from point A to B in a fiber, or a magnetic domain in a hard drive sitting there for some time interval.  Suppose that the noise in the channel causes the bit to flip with some probability p over the duration of the channel. In certain applications, a single bit error could have serious consequences, so we'd like to protect the bit.  We can do this by encoding it in redundant bits.
