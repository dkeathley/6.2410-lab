It is an excellent host substrate for optically active quantum emitters due to its wide bandgap (5.5 eV) and large transparency window. Among the many _color centers_ in diamond, the negatively charged NV center is most famous for applications in quantum sensing and communication. It is a defect in the carbon lattice consisting of a substitional nitrogen atom accompanied by a vacancy site (see the left figure below).\n","\n","<!-- <div>\n","<img src=\"./FIGURES/NV_center.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n","</div>\n"," -->\n",":::{figure-md} NV-center-fig\n","<img src=\"../FIGURES/NV_center.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","Figures adapted from quTools, quNV brochure.\n",":::\n","\n","\n","Effectively, NV center is an artificial atom in a solid state environment with well-defined optical transitions. More importantly, NV center's spin states have energy splitting sensitive to the environment's magnetic field strength. The greater the magnetic field strength, the greater the splitting. In a way, NV center itself is a _magnetic field sensor_. One can then readout the spin states (at microwave frequencies) to measure ambient magnetic field.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e331fcf6","metadata":{"id":"e331fcf6"},"source":["### 1.2 Level structure\n","\n","Now we briefly go over the level structure for NV center. If you are not familiar with atomic level structures, fear not! It is simply a diagram that locates the relative locations of different energy states. The exact details are not important, but for pedagogical sakes, I will briefly walk through what the above right diagram is trying to show.\n","\n","On the left-hand-side of the level structure, there are a ground state $^3$A and an excited state $^3$E. When the NV center decays from $^3$E to $^3$A, it emits a red photon at 637 nm. The reverse can also occur by shining the NV center with higher-energy (shorter wavelength) light at 532 nm such that it gets pumped from $^3$A to $^3$E.\n","\n","Next, we delve further into the different pathways the NV center can go from $^3$A to $^3$E. Within $^3$A, there exist three hyperfine states: $m_s=-1,0,+1$. Under zero magnetic field, the $m_s=\\pm 1$ states are _degenerate_, meaning they have the same energy. The difference in frequency between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=\\pm 1$ is $D=2.87$ GHz (caused by [crystal field splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_field_theory)). If the NV center begins at $m_s=0$ and is excited to the excited state $^3$E via 532 nm pumping, there is a strong probability that it would decay back to $m_s=0$ within $^3$A. However, if it begins at $m_s=\\pm 1$ and is excited to $^3$E, it is now more likely to undergo _intersystem crossing_, which is an another decay pathway that takes the NV center to a metastable $^1$A state. Afterwards, it would _preferentially decay back to $m_s=0$_. Two crucial take-aways here. One, this intersystem crossing process does not emiter 637 nm photons. Second, it preferentially returns what is initially $m_s=\\pm 1$ to $m_s=0$. Therefore, if you continuously pump the NV center with 532 nm light, in _steady state_, it would likely be in $m_s=0$. This mechanism is called spin polarization.\n","\n","Let's consider this continuous pumping (spin polarization) case. We expect the fluorescence intensity, i.e. the number of emitted 637 nm photons, to be constant in steady state. _However, when we apply a microwave drive at exactly 2.87 GHz, we start shuffling the state between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=\\pm 1$ via [Rabi oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_cycle)_. In this case, the fluorescence intensity would experience a dip. This phenomenon is called [optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optically_detected_magnetic_resonance).\n","\n",":::{figure-md} ODMR-fig\n","<img src=\"../FIGURES/ODMR.png\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","Optical detected magnetic resonance. Figures adapted from quTools, quNV brochure.\n",":::\n","\n","Recall previously, we assume there is no applied magnetic field such that $m_s=-1$ and $m_s=+1$ states are degenerate. If we do apply magnetic field to the NV center, however, the degeneracy would be broken. $m_s=-1$ and $m_s=+1$ states would start splitting apart, and their energy difference grows linearly with the magnetic field strength due to the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect). Now instead of 2.87 GHz, there would be two microwave frequencies at which the fluorescence intensity would experience a dip (can you see why?). Effectively, by detecting the optical signal coming from the NV center and noting where the changes in the intensity occur, we can extract information about the applied magnetic field. This means the NV center itself acts as a magnetometer!\n","\n","HOWEVER, realistically, the change in fluorescence is quite minimal. To make a magnetometer that is practical, we will pursue an alternative approach in this lab. Instead of inferring information about the magnetic field through _optical_ detection, we will attempt _microwave_ detection.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ee52650d","metadata":{"id":"ee52650d"},"source":["## 2.

One, we need to first excite the entire diamond with 532 nm light, hence spin polarizing an ensemble of NV centers.
