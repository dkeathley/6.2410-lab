    "\n",
    "### <u>For the following steps, please take extra care when handling the microwave cavities and the loop coupler!</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i) Estimate the cavity's resonance frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two microwave resonators provided to you. Both of them should have identical geometries, except with slightly different surface qualities. Take one of them and measure its outer radius and length. Use the measured geometry parameters and estimate the cavity's resonance frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Can you measure the resonance frequency via the VNA, whose bandwidth covers 100 kHz to 6 GHz?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>What would be the expected resonance frequency if you stack the two resonators on top of another, with their central holes as aligned as possible?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Can you measure the combined stack's resonance frequency via the VNA?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii) Build the RF circuitry for probing the cavity's resonance frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The VNA has a send port (Port 1) and a receive port (Port 2). Port 1 sends out a microwave tone by an internal signal generator, and port 2 measures the transmitted/reflected signal to compute the S-parameters. Use the provided [circulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulator) and note the numbers written on its, connect its ports to the VNA and the loop coupler appropriately such that the loop coupler can be used to probe the cavity's signal. Check with the TA after you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii) Measure the microwave resonator's frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with the loop coupler properly connected to the VNA via the circulator, first put on gloves and grab the pair of tweezers. Carefully place the resonator stack inside the magnetic shield on the cavity mount, as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "Mount the loop coupler such that it is directly above the resonator. You should use the [right-angle clamp](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RA90) to adjust the loop coupler position, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the libreVNA GUI and connect to the device. Make sure you are monitoring the \"S21\" window. Change the center frequency to what you estimated above for the stacked resonator. Change the span to 20 MHz. By adjusting the position of the loop coupler relative to the resonator, you should be able to observe the cavity resonance dip. Once you have done so, play around with the position of the loop coupler and observe how the cavity's observed loaded $Q$ and resonance frequency $\\omega_c$ change. <u>Write down your observations and explanations to these changes as a function of position.</u> In Aim 2, you will need to methodically measure the cavity resonance frequency and quality factor as a function of $z$.\n",

Obtain the nitrogen concentration under \"Materials Properties\" and assume that all nitrogen defects in the crystal lattice are converted to NV centers. Estimate the density of NV centers in diamond in units of NV/m$^3$.\n",

    "### Lab Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab session, you will be strictly working on creating a Python script that simulates the strong coupling dynamics between NV centers and the microwave resonator. In scientific research, it is often extremely valuable to be able to _predict_ how the experimental results may vary depending numerous parameters. By producing a [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin), you will be able to better understand the feasibility of using such a solid state spin-based system for performing quantum sensing.\n",

    "#### i) Estimate the microwave cavity's intrinsic quality factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data you have acquired last week, plot out the loaded $Q$ as a function of distance (in $z$) between the loop coupler and the top of the cavity. Rough estimation of the distance is fine. If you did not record the data from last week, you may repeat the same measurements. Be sure to have the loop coupler as directly above the microwave resonator to remove any $x,y$ dependence.\n",

    "Remember that the loaded $Q\\propto 1/\\kappa_c$ and the coupling rate to the loop coupler $\\kappa_1$ are both functions of $z$. Fit your plot with an exponential function, e.g. $\\propto 1-exp(-z)$, and estimate the intrinsic quality factor, $Q_0\\propto 1/\\kappa_0$.\n",
