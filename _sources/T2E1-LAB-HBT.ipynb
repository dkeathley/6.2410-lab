    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab we're going to perform the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) experiment with the quED set-up. We want to perform the measurements and also understand what they mean in terms of the calculations. This entire lab will take less than 2 sessions of the course, and it will help prepare you for performing the QKD protocol over the following 2 sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This write-up will cover a few topics:\n",
    "* [Lab Goals](#Goals-for-this-lab) are your guidance for what this experiment will accomplish. Your write-up should address all of these.\n",
    "* [Coincidence Estimate](#Estimate-coincidence-count-for-uncorrelated-sources) is an important calculation to do so you can make sure you're measuring what you expect. It will also be an example of relating a measured experimental to a theoretical calculation.\n",
    "* [quED power up](#quED-power-up) describes how to turn on the quED to begin taking data.\n",
    "* [Experimental set-up: 2-fold](#HBT-with-2-fold-coincidence) gives an overview on how to perform the 2-fold experiment. There is a [Python cell](#g2code2fold) for you to input your experimental measurements and find $g^{(2)}(0)$\n",
    "* [Experimental set-up: 3-fold](#HBT-for-heralded-source-(3-fold-coincidence)) gives an overview on how to perform the 3-fold experiment. There is a [Python cell](#g2code3fold) for you to input your experimental measurements and find $g^{(2)}(0)$\n",

    "## Goals for this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we have a few goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measure $g^{(2)}(0)$ for the SPDC output in the heralded and un-heralded regimes. You will need to take enough points to find both an average and a standard deviation. How did you choose which integration time to use?\n",
    "1. Compare $g^{(2)}(0)$ measurements for different pump laser currents: 10 mA, 25 mA, and 40 mA. Again, make sure you take enough data points to find the variance.\n",
    "1. Compare your experimental results with what you calculated. How did your calculations match your measurements? Why do you think they were different? \n",
    "1. Use the $g^{(2)}(0)$ measurements to categorize when the SPDC output counts as a single photon source. Consider whether you would classify the light source as being in a number state, coherent state, or thermal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you will need to address all of these points above in your 2-3 page write-up at the end of this T2E1 lab sequence.  It is then important we address these issues properly during lab time. Also remember that everyone is expected to keep notes during the lab, and you should include collected data, code, and analysis in those notes.  The instructions you're reading right now are meant to guide you through taking the data and looking at some of the data analysis."

    "You'll note that this equation has nothing to do with the coincidence window $\\Delta_w$, but consider the following thought experiment. Keeping integration time $T$ constant, you look at coincidences $\\langle\\hat{n}_1\\hat{n}_2\\rangle$ using an infinitely long coincidence window and then you perform the same measurement at an infinitely small but still nonzero coincidence window. Do you expect to see more coincidences on the long or short window? Thus, coincidence windows do matter in terms of scaling for $g^{(2)}(0)$.\n",

    "For this reason, we want to look at the calculation in a slightly different way. Specifically, consider that the calculation asks for the expected value of the coincidences and singles. What we measure are the rates, $R_i$ of the singles and coincidences, expressed in counts per second (cps). That means that to find a probability, $p_i$, within a given coincidence time, $\\Delta_w$, we need to consider\n",
