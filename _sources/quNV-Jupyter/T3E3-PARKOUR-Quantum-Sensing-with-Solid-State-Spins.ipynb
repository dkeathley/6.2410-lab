    "## TRAINING: Interfacing with the Vector Network Analyzer\n",
    "In this exercise, we will practice using Python to communicate with the vector network analyzer (VNA), which allows us to probe the microwave cavity's frequency response. In short, the VNA acts as both a signal generator and a receiver. Within a defined frequency sweep, $\\omega\\in[\\omega_1,\\omega_2]$, it sends a signal at frequency $\\omega$ and measures the reflected power off the cavity. When $\\omega$ is resonant with the cavity's resonance frequency $\\omega_c$, i.e. $\\omega=\\omega_c$, the reflected power would be minimal. This will be covered in more details in the textbook. For now, we will focus on writing a small piece of code to send commands to the VNA, and collecting the relevant measurement data, $S_{21}$."
