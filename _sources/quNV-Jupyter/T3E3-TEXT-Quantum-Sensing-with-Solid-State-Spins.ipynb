    "\n",
    "Diamond is a particularly interesting material in the realm of quantum information science. It is an excellent host substrate for optically active quantum emitters due to its wide bandgap (5.5 eV) and large transparency window. Among the many _color centers_ in diamond, the negatively charged NV center is most famous for applications in quantum sensing and communication. It is a defect in the carbon lattice consisting of a substitional nitrogen atom accompanied by a vacancy site (see the left figure below).\n",

    "### 1.2 Triplet and singlet states:\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of the NV centers here is that they have two unpaired electrons. Remember that electrons are spin $\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ particles with spin $+\\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\\frac{1}{2}$, which we will denote as $⇑$ and $⇓$, respectively. The spins of these elecrons can be summed using [Clebesh-Gordan coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients), resulting in sum states of the form $|S,m_s⟩$, where $S$ is the magnitude of the spin, and $m_s$ is the projection onto the axis for which we are measuring spin. From two spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, we get the resulting states:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first three cases, where $S=1$, we consider the electron spins to be \"aligned\", in that their individual spin vectors add up to a magntidue of 1. These are called _triplet states_. Note that in the $|1,0⟩$ state, the projection of the two spins onto our measurement axis is opposite, but the other components do not cancel out, resulting the magnitude of this sum still being 1.\n",

    "### 1.3 Breaking degeneracy in triplet states:\n",
    "\n",
    "In an isolated atom (or artificial atom, like an NV center), all individual states of a triplet state would be degenerate, or having the same energy. We can see in the NV center energy level diagram, however, that this is not the case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can look at is the energy difference between the $m_s=0$ states and the $m_s=\\pm 1$ states, which occurs without the presence of a magnetic field. This energy difference is therefore called the _zero-field splitting_. It is caused by [crystal field splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_field_theory). The NV center is located in a crystal lattice, with surrounding atoms. Electrostatic influence from nearby atoms breaks the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to distinct energy levels. For this lab we are concerned with the zero-field splitting of the triplet ground state, which corresponds to 2.87GHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we also note a further energy splitting between the $m_s=+1$ and $m_s=-1$ states in the presence of the external magnetic field. This is caused by the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect). Due to its spin, orbit, and charge properties, an electron has a magnetic moment:\n",
    "$$\\vec{μ}=\\mu_B g \\vec{J} /ħ =\\mu_B(g_l \\vec{L} + g_s \\vec{S})/ħ$$\n",

The Lande g-factor depends on $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$, and on constants $g_l=1$ and $g_s≈2$, where $g_s$ is known as the \"anomalous gyromagnetic ratio\". In the NV center, however, the ground triplet state has zero angular momentum, and $S=1$ so this reduces to:\n",

    "Quantization forces electronspins to align parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field. Thus, the $m_s=\\pm 1$ ground states get energy shifts of $ΔE=\\pm\\mu_B g_s B / \\hbar $. It is this energy shift that we will use to measure magnetic field.\n",

    "### 1.4 Energy transitions in NV centers\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left-hand-side of the level structure, there is the ground triplet state  $^3A$ and an excited triplet state  $^3E$. By shining the NV center with 532 nm light, it can be pumped from $^3A$ to $^3E$. The NV center will them proceed to decay from $^3E$ to $^3A$ along some pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important determining factor for the decay pathway is the spin state the NV center started in. Generally speaking, transitions between states tend to be spin-preserving. For example, an NV center in the $m_s=0$ ground state will be pumped to the $m_s=0$ excited state and will generally decay directly back to the $m_s=0$ ground state, emitting a 637 nm photon. This describes most transitions, becaues the $m_s=0$ ground state is the lowest energy state, and thus will have the highest population.\n",
    "\n",
    "NV centers in the $m_s = \\pm 1$ ground states will generally likewise be pumped to the $m_s = \\pm 1$ excited states, and can radiatively decay to the $m_s = \\pm 1$ ground states.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, NV centers contain a meta-stable singlet state $^1A$, which provides an alternate (and more likely), non-radiative decay pathway for NV centers in the $m_s = \\pm 1$, $^3E$ states. By definition, singlet states have $m_s=0$. However, NV centers can still decay from $^3E$, $m_s=\\pm 1$ states to $^1A$ due to \"spin-orbit coupling\". This is a relativistic effect causing electron spins to interact with their orbits, allowing for transitions where spin angular momentum can exchange with orbital angular momentum. Therefore, some transitions are allowed where spin is not conserved (but total angular momentum will still be conserved). Such a transition is known as an \"intersystem crossing\". NV centers that end up in this $^1A$ state will then preferentially decay to the $m_s = 0$, $^3A$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, an NV center pumped from the $^3A$ state to the $^3E$ state will usually return to the $m_s = 0$, $^3A$ state, even if it started at $m_s = \\pm 1$. In steady state, an NV center will then most likely be in $m_s=0$. This mechanism is called _spin-polarization_. A decay from $^3E$, $m_s = 0$ will emit a photon, a decay from $^3E$, $m_s = \\pm 1$ will tyically not emit a photon."

With the NV center pumped by 532 nm light, this results in a dip in the fluoresence, as more NV centers start in the $m_s = \\pm 1$ ground states, which are more likely to decay non-radiatively. This phenomenon is called [optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optically_detected_magnetic_resonance).\n",

    "So far, we have discussed two distinct entities, NV centers in diamond and microwave cavity. In our experiment, we will combine the two systems by simply putting a diamond sample full of NV centers inside the microwave resonator. There are two conditions we must first satisfy in order to observe quantum sensing with solid state spins. One, we need to first excite the entire diamond with 532 nm light, hence spin polarizing an ensemble of NV centers. Second, we need to apply the appropriate amount of magnetic field to shift the energy level of $m_s=+1$, such that the frequency difference between $m_s=+1$ and $m_s=0$ matches the resonance frequency of the microwave resonator. When the aforementioned conditions are met, we can observe the quantum mechanical response of the coupled system (consisted of NV centers and microwave cavity) by sending a microwave signal and measuring its reflection coefficient. Experimentally, we will have the VNA send microwave pulses across different frequencies down the loop coupler, which returns reflected pulses from the microwave cavity back to the receiving port of the VNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma = -1+\\frac{\\kappa_{c1}}{\\frac{\\kappa_c}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_c)+\\frac{g^2}{\\frac{\\kappa_s}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_s)+\\alpha}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa_c=\\kappa_{c0}+\\kappa_{c1}$ is the sum of the unloaded (intrinsic) and input port (loop coupler) loss rates, respectively. $\\kappa_s=2/T_2$ is the homogeneous width of the spin resonance where $T_2$ is the [coherence time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)). $\\alpha$ captures the effect of saturation and is beyond the scope of this introductory discussion. $g$ is the effective coupling strength between the NV centers and the cavity mode. $\\omega$ and $\\omega_s$ are the probe (sent out of the VNA) and the spin resonance frequencies, respectively. Since there are parameters regarding the NV centers themselves, the _quality_ of the diamond indeed affects the reflection contrast. You will explore different types of diamond in this lab.\n",

Obtain the nitrogen concentration under \"Materials Properties\" and assume that all nitrogen defects in the crystal lattice are converted to NV centers. Estimate the density of NV centers in diamond in units of NV/m$^3$.\n",
