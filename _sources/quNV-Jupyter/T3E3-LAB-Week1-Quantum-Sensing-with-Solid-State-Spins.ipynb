Recall that a cavity $Q$ is defined to be the ratio of its resonance frequency to its decay rate (also known as the cavity _linewidth_).\n","\n","1. Calculate the $Q$ of a cavity with resonance frequency at 3 GHz and linewidth of 100 kHz.\n","2. Typically the cavity linewidth is defined at the [full width at half maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum). Insert a cell below and write a Python script plotting a resonance peak centered at 3 GHz with linewidth of 100 kHz. Make the x-axis frequency with a span of 1 MHz and the y-axis normalized cavity transmission. Note that the cavity lineshape is usually [Lorentzian](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorentzianFunction.html).\n","\n","The second part involves characterizing the [Helmholtz coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil) by measuring its generated magnetic field. Recall that due to the Zeeman effect, magnetic field is used to shift the energy (frequency) difference between the $m_s=0$ and $m_s= \\pm 1$ states of NV centers. Importantly, the correct amount of magnetic field must be applied to ensure one of the energy differences matches the microwave cavity's resonance frequency.\n","\n","3. The amount of frequency shift due to magnetic field strength $B$ is $\\delta f = \\mu B$, where $\\mu = \\mu_B g/h$. $\\mu_B$ is the [Bohr magneton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_magneton), $g\\approx 2$ is the Lande factor, and $h$ is the Planck constant. Calculate $\\mu$ in units of MHz/Gauss. Note the SI unit for magnetic field is Tesla, where 1 Tesla = $10^4$ Gauss.\n","4. Assume you have a cavity resonant at 3GHz. Which energy difference would you align to the cavity resonance: $m_s=0$ and $m_s=+1$, or $m_s=0$ and $m_s=-1$? Why? Recall the starting point (due to crystal field splitting) of the energy difference between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=\\pm 1$ is 2.87 GHz.\n","5.

In scientific research, it is often extremely valuable to be able to _predict_ how the experimental results may vary depending numerous parameters. By producing a [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin), you will be able to better understand the feasibility of using such a solid state spin-based system for performing quantum sensing.\n","\n","#### i) Estimate the microwave cavity's intrinsic quality factor\n","\n","Last time, you observed changes in the cavity resonance as you adjusted the loop coupler. This session, you will measure quantitatevely to determine the cavity's intrinsic Q. Remember that the loaded $Q\\propto 1/\\kappa_c$ and the coupling rate to the loop coupler $\\kappa_1$ are both functions of $z$.\n","\n","Measure and record the loaded $Q$ at various loop coupler heights. Be sure to have the loop coupler as directly above the microwave resonator to remove any $x,y$ dependence. The cable to the loop coupler can bend slightly. You will have some flexibility in how to measure height. Rough measurement is ok. Note that you do not need to directly measure $z$ (height between the loop and top of the cavity); a height meausrement relative to a convenient feature will work. If you record multiple heights with a common offset, you will be able to fit for this offset and recover that actual $z$. Fit your plot with an exponential function, e.g. $\\propto 1-exp(-z)$ (add an appropriate offset term if necessary). Use your fit to estimate the intrinsic quality factor, $Q_0\\propto 1/\\kappa_0$.\n","\n","Then, generate a plot of $\\kappa_1$ as a function of $z$.\n","\n","#### ii) Plot the frequency difference between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=\\pm 1$ states as a function of magnetic field (in Gauss)\n","\n","#### iii) Generate a 1D plot of the cavity reflection coefficient\n","\n","Recall that the cavity reflection coefficient is defined as:\n","\n","$$\\Gamma(\\omega) = -1+\\frac{\\kappa_{c1}}{\\frac{\\kappa_c}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_c)+\\frac{g^2}{\\frac{\\kappa_s}{2}+j(\\omega-\\omega_s)+\\alpha}}$$\n","\n","For simplicity, let's first take $g=0$.
