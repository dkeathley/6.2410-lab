    "\n",
    "Last week you spent some time finding $g^{(2)}(0)$ of the SPDC source and looking at the mean number of photons in a pulse. The motivation for doing that was to verify we had an appropriate source for our QKD setup. This is important because...\n",
    "\n",
    "### BB84's security is based on the no-cloning theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The no-cloning theorem states that for a given quanta in a superposition of eigenstates, it's impossible to produce a perfect copy. For more information, see eg [Wootters and Zurek 1982](\"https://www.nature.com/articles/299802a0\") or [Dieks 1982](\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375960182900846?via%3Dihub\"). In short, it means that if eavesdropper Eve listens in by: (1) intercepting the photons Alice sends to Bob; (2) measuring them; and (3) then pretending to be Alice by sending identical photons to Bob, she'll create errors in the system that Alice and Bob can detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice sends more than one photon to Bob, Eve can perform a photon number splitting attack, which you can read more about in [Brassard, Lutkenhaus, Mor, Sanders 2000](\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1330\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The HBT set-up showed us that using just one output from the SPDC isn't a true single photon source. So, we can approximate that by modeling it as a weak pulse with Poissonian statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for a Poisson distribution with mean value $\\lambda$ the probability of obtaining value k is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(k) = e^{-\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can adjust $\\lambda$ by adjusting the laser current and the pulse duration for the pump laser.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Implementation Note** You need to play with the repetition rate, laser current, and pulse duration to ensure that you are only sending around 1 photon per transmission event.  Otherwise your protocol will be vulnerable to eavesdropping and would not be a true implementation of BB84.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** When switching to pulsed mode the repetition rate shown might not be what is set on the instrument.  You should hit enter in that box to send the setting to the instrument and ensure what you see is what is actually being used!\n",

Even though Alice and Bob are using the same basis, they won't get a bit for their raw key from that photon.\n",

    "Now that Alice and Bob have an estimate of the quantum BER, they can evaluate to what degree Eve is interfering in their key distribution and if error correction coding will help them. If the qBER is too high (for this particular scheme, the cutoff is when qBER $\\geq 0.14$), the error-correction code will actually make the BER worse. This scheme can correct 1 error in every block of 7 bits.\n",

    "The Hamming code works in the following way: Bob and Alice take their raw key (`a` for Alice and `b` for Bob) and break it into blocks of 7 bits. Each block is multiplied by a 3x7 Hamming matrix `H`. For Alice, this results in `Ha` and for Bob `Hb`. Then Alice sends `Ha` to Bob. Bob finds `Ha - Hb = He` where `e` is the error vector, ie the vector that indicates whether `a == b` for each element. From there, Bob finds `e` and can use that to locate and then correct his bits. For a more in-depth explanation, I highly recommend checking out the linked section."
